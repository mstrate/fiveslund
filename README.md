# Strate Demo

Simple demo repo to read data from a source json file, process the data, and write out the processed data to a destination json file.  The intent is to demonstrate basic pattern use & code styling/conventions.  Some items of note:
- `Strate.Demo.Program` is the entry point
- Settings are specified in /Strate.Demo/App.config
- Code standards used are those used on my current team.
 
Coding Standards
- `var` used when possible
- Comments for all public / protected items
- Zero inline comments unless the logic requires some description.  The code should be self describing.
